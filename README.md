<h1>Hello world!</h1>

<p>
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sam!<br />
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in learning Python, Javascript, C++/C# and SQL.<br />

I'm a self-taught programmer with a unique background in finance and accounting. I have always liked solving problems and there's always problems to solve in data.
  
Currently working on the CS50x course.
Future plans to undertake freeCodeCamp front-end side.
Please take a look at my repositories to see what else I'm up to!
